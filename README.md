# Links

Very easy to configure and change HTML/CSS/JS website for links like LinkTree or alternatives. Made using TailwindCSS (CDN). Background is from `nxtlnk`.

## TODO (Contributions Welcomed)

- Make the links work properly in modal
- Make different type of buttons
- Refactor some Tailwind classes (Especially in &lt;a&gt;)
